## Feedback/Contributing
As this is a personnal project, directly contributing to the code isn't possible. However, I very gladly encourage code reviews, suggestions, bug reports through either issues or pull requests. Please keep in mind that it is a solo student project, and that I'm trying to cram features in a short time period.

## Building
Don't forget to use --recurse-submodules when cloning the repo.

## Disclaimer
I don't own the models used in the releases or the repo.
